## Angular Demo App V3 (WIP)

> A reusable CRM starter project for real-world business based on Angular 19, Angular-Material 19.x.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.x. The goal of this project is to create reusable project for real-world business. To achieve this target, we need a solution which includes simple authentication process, restful API feature with token support and simple but elegant UI design.





### Live Demo
[Demo App](https://angular-app-demo.harryho.org): The demo is just a proof of concept. It doesn't have back-end API and all features of master branch.

###  Change log

* Dec 2024 - Uplift from version 9 to 19

* Jun 2020 - Re-create the project with Angular CLI

  The whole project is built from scratch based on the Angular CLI & Angular Material Schematics.

* Oct 2018 - Rebase demo branch to master

  New master doesn't rely on Json-Server as fake API. It will only have Readonly fake API. It means any new or updated data will be stored to any physical file. All test data will be rolled back after system restart.

* Jan 2018 - Create an archived branch json-server

  This branch was the master which used Json-Server as fake API. Considering the hiccup of setting Json-Server up and maintenance, it will be replaced by fake service ( Readonly fake API). You still can find clone this branch by branch name __json-server__, but it will be no longer updated. It is an archived branch.
